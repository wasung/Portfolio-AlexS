# Guerilla Analytics

The goal is to apply the **Guerrilla Analytics** framework to structure and document a project in a reproducible, collaborative, and future-proof way.

The focus is on organizing a project (RNAseq & metagenomics analysis)

## **Organize Your  Project**
I made a native folder and organised this with empty files in the way you would according to Guerilla analytics

To showcase your new project structure:

``` {r Generate folder tree generated folder}
library(fs)

# Print your current directory tree (recursively)
dir_tree("Opdracht 5 - Guerilla analytics", recurse = TRUE)
```
---

## Organisation of current folder
I also tried to make use of the guidelines of Guerilla analytics for this folder:


```{r generate-folder-tree}
library(fs)

# Print the directory tree of the current working directory
dir_tree(".", recurse = TRUE)
```
