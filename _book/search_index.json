I am still highly interested in the life science sector but want to be involved in other sides of the sector. I feel like doing the data science course is something I did because I feel like its a valuable hardskill to have as I am still considering working in finance or BI. In this field its good to already have knowledge in data workflows and analysis. 3.1 Professional development To reach these goals I have a long way to go and a lot to learn in and outside of my educational carreer. During the DSFB course we are free to work on a datascience or bioinformatics related skill. For this I am probably looking at BI or python since this aligns most with what I want in my carreer. For my internship I am mainly looking at sequencing companies, they do both short and long read, but since I dont have any experience with short read sequencing I want to learn more about it. (DNA short read illumna?). (still looking into making it more concrete.)

See if you can spot anything peculiar about this file. Do not edit the file in any way. Just close it when you are done.

There is a ‘Raw data’ column, what does this mean and what is it for? Also would be nice to have some explanation on all the colours and why does the pink column run down so far. The other tabs are even more unclear its hard to find where things are and even more hard to find what it means.
