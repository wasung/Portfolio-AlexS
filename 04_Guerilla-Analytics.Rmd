# Guerilla Analytics
Need to run the data at home through the pipe and clean up the folders still ( will use projecticum folders).
## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, the goal is to apply the **Guerrilla Analytics** framework to structure and document your project in a reproducible, collaborative, and future-proof way.

The focus is on organizing both:
- The **DAUR-II** project (RNAseq & metagenomics analysis), and
- The **Projecticum** (ongoing group project in DSFB2)

---

### 1. **Reorganize Your DAUR-II Project**

- Locate RStudio project folder used for the **DAUR-II assignments**.
- Download your work without the heavy data files
- Restructure the folder according to the Guerrilla Analytics folder principles

#### Data folders should contain:
- Only a `README.txt` file
- The `README.txt` should include:
  - Description of the dataset
  - Data format
  - Where the data is stored (path or location)
  - Any preprocessing steps or notes

---

### 2. **Apply to Your RNAseq and Metagenomics Work**

You previously worked with:

- **3 RNAseq datasets**
  - One of them was the **exam project**
- **2 Metagenomics datasets**

For each dataset:
- Create a **modular folder** (e.g., `Data001`, `Data002`, etc.)
- Add a `README.txt` inside each module
- Add any import or checksum scripts to a `supporting/` subfolder

---

### 3. **Use the `{fs}` Package to Generate a Folder Tree Screenshot**

To showcase your new project structure:

``` {r Generate folder tree}
library(fs)

# Print your current directory tree (recursively)
dir_tree("guerrilla-project", recurse = TRUE)
```
