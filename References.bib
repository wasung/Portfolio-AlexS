  abstract = {Environmental monitoring represents an integral part of the microbiological quality control system of a pharmaceutical manufacturing operation. However, guidance documents differ regarding recommendation of a procedure, particularly regarding incubation time, incubation temperature, or nutrient media. Because of these discrepancies, many manufacturers decide for a particular environmental monitoring sample incubation strategy and support this decision with validation data. Such validations are typically laboratory-based in vitro studies, meaning that these are based on comparing incubation conditions and nutrient media through use of cultured microorganisms. An informal survey of the results of these in vitro studies performed at Novartis or European manufacturing sites of different pharmaceutical companies highlighted that no consensus regarding the optimal incubation conditions for microbial recovery existed. To address this question differently, we collected a significant amount of samples directly from air, inanimate surfaces, and personnel in pharmaceutical production and packaging rooms during manufacturing operation (in situ study). Samples were incubated under different conditions suggested in regulatory guidelines, and recovery of total aerobic microorganisms as well as moulds was assessed. We found the highest recovery of total aerobic count from areas with personnel flow using a general microbiological growth medium incubated at 30--35 {$^\circ$}C. The highest recovery of moulds was obtained with mycological medium incubated at 20--25 {$^\circ$}C. Single-plate strategies (two-temperature incubation or an intermediate incubation temperature of 25--30 {$^\circ$}C) also yielded reasonable recovery of total aerobic count and moulds. However, recovery of moulds was found to be highly inefficient at 30--35 {$^\circ$}C compared to lower incubation temperatures. This deficiency could not be rectified by subsequent incubation at 20--25 {$^\circ$}C. A laboratory-based in vitro study performed in parallel was inconclusive. We consider our results potentially conferrable to other pharmaceutical manufacturing sites in moderate climate zones and believe that these should represent a valuable reference for definition of the incubation strategy of microbiological environmental monitoring samples. LAY ABSTRACT: Microbiological environmental monitoring confirms that pharmaceutical cleanrooms are in an appropriate hygienic condition for manufacturing of drug products. Guidance documents from different health authorities or expert groups differ regarding recommendation of the applied incubation time, incubation temperature, or nutrient media. Therefore, many pharmaceutical manufacturers perform studies that aim to identify the optimal incubation setup for environmental monitoring samples. An informal survey of the results of such studies, which had been performed at Novartis or European manufacturing sites of different pharmaceutical companies, highlighted no consensus regarding the optimal incubation conditions for microbial recovery. All these studies had been conducted in the laboratory using selections of cultured microbial strains. We tried to solve this disagreement by collecting a significant amount of real environmental monitoring samples directly from the environment in pharmaceutical production and packaging rooms during manufacturing operation. These samples were then incubated under different conditions suggested in the regulatory guidelines. We believe that the results of our study are more meaningful than laboratory-based experiments because we used environmental samples with microorganisms directly isolated from the manufacturing area. Therefore, we believe that our results should represent a valuable reference for definition of the incubation strategy of microbiological environmental monitoring samples.},

  abstract = {Mycoplasma contamination in cell culture is considered as serious problem in the manufacturing of biological products. Our goal in this research is to find the best standard and rapid method with high sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and predictive values of positive and negative results for detection of mycoplasma contamination in cell cultures of the National Cell Bank of Iran. In this study, 40 cell lines suspected to mycoplasma contamination were evaluated by three different methods: microbial culture, enzymatic mycoalert({\textregistered}) and molecular. Enzymatic evaluation was performed using the mycoalert({\textregistered}) kit while in the molecular technique, a universal primer pair was designed based on the common and fixed 16SrRNA ribosomal sequences used. Mycoplasma contaminations in cell cultures with molecular, enzymatic and microbial culture methods were determined as 57.5, 52.5 and 40~\%, respectively. These results confirmed the higher rate of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the molecular method in comparison with enzymatic and microbial methods. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay based on fixed and common sequences in the 16SrRNA, is a useful valuable and reliable technique with high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detection of mycoplasma contamination in cell cultures and other biological products. The enzymatic mycoalert({\textregistered}) method can be considered as a substitution for conventional microbial culture and DNA staining fluorochrome methods due to its higher sensitivity, specificity and speed of detection ({$<$}20 min).},

  abstract = {Introduction Quality and safety of a cell product, essential to guarantee the health of patients, depends on many factors including an appropriate environmental monitoring of the manufacturing rooms. Nonetheless, the maintenance of a controlled environment is requested to minimize the risk of contamination. Thus, a timely detection of changes in microbiological trends is important to adopt promptly effective measures against resistant strains that, in turn, may invalidate not only the sanitization procedures but also the safety of the cell product. Methods We analyzed microbes found in our cell processing clean room over the last 5 years. We used 10.147 plates for air sampler, passive air monitoring and for checking instruments and operators of the production unit. Results From these plates, 747 colonies were subjected to identification by the MALDI-TOF Vitek{\textregistered} MS system and the large majority of them was gram positive (97.8\%) as witnessed by the finding that the most represented genera harvested from the classified areas were Staphylococcus (65\%), Micrococcus (13\%), Kocuria (8\%) and Bacillus (5\%). We never detected fungi. Most microbes found in the operators (both from class A and B) were collected from forearms and resulted of the Staphylococcus genus. Conclusions The observed microbial contamination is to be attributed to the personnel and no substantial microbial pitfalls in our Cell Factory has been detected.},

  abstract = {Cleanroom microflora are of importance for microbiologists and quality control personnel in order to assess changes in trends. Shifts in the types of microflora may indicate deviations from the ``norm'' such as resistant strains or problems with cleaning practices. Given the few published studies of the typical microflora, this paper uniquely reviews over 9000 microbial isolates from a range of different grades of cleanroom. The paper concludes that the typical flora are primarily those associated with human skin (Gram-positive cocci), although microorganisms from other sources such as the environment (Gram-positive rods) and water (Gram-negative rods) are also detected, although in lower numbers. LAY ABSTRACT: It is of importance that pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare pharmacies review the types and numbers of microorganisms found within their clean areas. Such examination should be carried out over a long period of time so that the complete picture can be revealed. This is important in order to understand if certain species are being recovered pose a product or environmental risk and to check if the cleaning and sanitization practices are effective.},
