# genetrackR
This package is designed to read, count, normalize, and visualize RNA-seq data at the gene level. It takes BAM files as input and leverages Bioconductor tools such as GenomicAlignments, GenomicFeatures, and SummarizedExperiment for efficient processing.

The package includes four core functions:
- countReads() – counts reads per gene from BAM files
- normalizeCounts() – normalizes count matrices using CPM or TPM
- plotGeneExpression() – visualizes gene expression per gene or per sample
- exportResults() – exports tables or plots as CSV/PNG files

The package features a vignette explaining how to use it with example RNA-seq data.

The package is hosted on GitHub and can be installed via:
devtools::install_github("wasung/genetrackR")
