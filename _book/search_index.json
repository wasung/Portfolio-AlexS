Rather than remaining solely in the laboratory, Im increasingly motivated by the idea of playing a more strategic rolewhere science, data, and business come together to create real-world impact. I want to be involved in designing solutions, informing decisions, and shaping the direction of healthcare innovations, particularly in fields where science meets patient outcomes and commercial viability. To support this shift, I chose to pursue the Data Science for Biology minor alongside my Bachelors in Life Sciences. This combination reflects my desire to bridge hard scientific knowledge with analytical and business-oriented thinking. I believe that fluency in datawhether its understanding experimental design, visualizing trends, or interpreting statistical outcomesis a crucial skill in almost any role across life sciences, biotech, and healthcare consulting. From my perspective, knowing how to work with data empowers you to be not just a practitioner, but also a decision-maker. While my initial goal was to find an internship specifically focused on data science or sequencing, I ultimately accepted a position at a cell and gene therapy facilityan opportunity that has proven both challenging and eye-opening. Working in this highly regulated environment has taught me a great deal about Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), cleanroom operations, and contamination control strategies. Ive been involved in environmental monitoring and performance qualification (PQ) processes, all of which have given me a deeper appreciation for the complexities of translating research into safe, scalable therapies. While this internship doesnt involve coding or computational analysis directly, its reinforcing my understanding of the operational and regulatory backbone of modern therapeuticssomething I consider just as important. Looking further ahead, I see strategy consulting as the most likely next step in my career. Im especially interested in specializing within the healthcare and life sciences sector, where I can apply my background to strategic challenges in pharma, biotech, or health tech. However, I remain open and excited to explore other industries as well, particularly during the early stages of my consulting journey. I value the opportunity to learn across a wide range of business contexts and expand my thinking beyond my academic background. To prepare for this next phase, Ive applied to the pre-master programme at Erasmus University Rotterdam, with the goal of continuing on to a Master in Management. This academic step will allow me to deepen my understanding of business, strategy, and organizational dynamics, and will complement the technical and scientific knowledge Ive built during my Life Sciences degree. In short, Im still evolving as a professional, but Im actively shaping my own trajectory. Im seeking out the tools, experiences, and mindsets that will help me growand Im committed to building a career that blends the depth of science with the breadth of strategy. Professional Development As part of the Data Science for Biology course, we are allocated time to independently explore a bioinformatics-related topic of our choice. Ive chosen to focus on variant calling, specifically using the Variant Tools package available via Conda, as this aligns with my interest in genomics and data-driven biological insights. I plan to apply these skills in a self-directed project using a publicly available dataset, allowing me to gain hands-on experience beyond the classroom or lab setting. Outside of this academic framework, Im continuing to build up my data skills independently. Ive been exploring tools like Power BI to strengthen my business intelligence capabilities, and Im actively learning more about Python for data analysis. I believe that by combining my scientific background with growing analytical and technical expertise, Ill be well-positioned for cross-disciplinary roles  whether in consulting, biotech strategy, or data-driven innovation within the healthcare sector.

Question E: When creating the plot under C), what happened with the ordering of the x-axis labels. Explain why this happens. Look at the data-type of the compConcentration column in the data again to find a clue. The x-axis labels overlap, you need to angle them slightly so all labels are readable. The positive control for this experiments is controlPositive. (H) The negative control for this experiment is controlNegative. Question I: Think about how you would analyze this experiment to learn whether there is indeed an effect of different concentrations on offspring count and whether the different compounds have a different curve (IC50). Write down you analysis as a step-wise plan. Step-wise plan (need to make) Question K Normalize the data for the controlNegative in such a way that the mean value for controlNegative is exactly equal to 1 and that all other values are expressed as a fraction thereof. Rerun your graphs with the normalized data. Why would you want to take this step? It makes it easier to compare relative changes across different conditions and facilitates the interpretation of treatment effects.
