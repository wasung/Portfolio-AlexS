I am still highly interested in the life science sector but want to be involved in other sides of the sector. I feel like doing the data science course is something I did because I feel like its a valuable hardskill to have as I am still considering working in finance or BI. In this field its good to already have knowledge in data workflows and analysis. 3.1 Professional development To reach these goals I have a long way to go and a lot to learn in and outside of my educational carreer. During the DSFB course we are free to work on a datascience or bioinformatics related skill. For this I am probably looking at BI or python since this aligns most with what I want in my carreer.

See if you can spot anything peculiar about this file. Do not edit the file in any way. Just close it when you are done. (Annoyingly, Excel asks you to save your changes, even if you did not touch anything in the file.)” A: Parameters tab is unclear what colomn means what. There is a ‘Raw data’ column, what does this mean and what is it for? Also would be nice to have some explanation on all the colours and why does the pink column run down so far. The other tabs are even more unclear its hard to find where things are and even more hard to find what it means.

Here 2 companies are acknowledged for the provision of vaccines, it is rather unclear if these were provided for free or bought. 6.1.5 Data availability statement and location There is a small section where supplementary materials can be accessed. THere is a download link to the ‘data sheet’. The sheet is a word doc with the processed data in figures in a doc file. Access to raw data would be better to have. It does however mention that you can inquire for more data but it requires you to contact the authors but, there is no author contact info available. Furthermore no code was used for this research.
